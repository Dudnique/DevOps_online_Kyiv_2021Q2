A wired router makes it possible to connect two or more devices, combining them into a single network. The principle of connection is very simple - a special cable is pulled from each stationary computer or laptop, which is inserted into the socket of the router.

Benefits of using a router:

- stable quality of signal transmission;
- higher connection speed;
- Possibility of additional connection of printers, faxes, scanners and other devices;
- long service life.

The ideal option for such a connection would be a home or office network, where stationary devices are mainly used. Despite all the advantages, a wired connection has some disadvantages and features. Firstly, the cost of purchasing a cable and its laying increases. Secondly, such a connection is not suitable for working with mobile devices that do not have a specific connection to a specific place - tablets, smartphones. The total cost of a router with connecting wires and additional accessories (holders, cable channels) can be quite high.

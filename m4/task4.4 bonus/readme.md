## TASK 4.4
During the process of completing this part of the task:
1) the project specified in the assignment has been designed; 
2) its' performance has been checked;
### Since a mistake was made in setting task 4.3, and to configure routing using the RIP protocol, it is necessary to use 2 routers, and not 1 as it was shown, task 4.4.1 duplicates task 4.3. And as already written in task 4.4.1, if there are already 2 routers in our network and the traffic is configured, then its execution is not required. so I add screenshots from task 4.3. 
#### Created and configured project 4.4.1 :
